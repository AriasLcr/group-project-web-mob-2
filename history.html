    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Unix was created in the mid-1960s by researchers at Bell Labs who needed more clarification on the complexity of Multics. The operating system was initially without organizational backing and was called Unics. It was written in assembly language but later rewritten in C.Unix's influence led to commercial startups' large-scale adoption of Unix (BSD and System V). Unix became the operating system of choice for over 90% of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers and is widely used in modern servers, workstations, and mobile devices.</p>
